# Analytical-Contaminant-Transport-Equation
Plotting contaminant concentrations using the formula as defined by Domenico and Robbins, 1985

This programs displays a scatter plot of contaminant concentrations in a 2-Dimensional environment using the Analytical Contaminant Transport Equation (Domenico and Robins, 1985).
This equation is used in hydrogeology to predict the sub-surface spread of hazardous contaminants, and in many other geological science fields. 
While certain assumptions must be made about the consistency of longitudinal and transverse dispersivities of the sub-surface materials, it can provide insight into the general movement of contaminants.
The equation as used does not account for a contaminant that undergoes radioactive decay, or any other form of decay.

Example parameters have been provided in the main() function. 
Feel free to manipulate as much as you would like to see the impact on the spread of the contaminant.

The program prompts the user for a specific x,y coordinate to simulate taking a reading from a specific well, but it is not a requirement.
